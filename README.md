# Book-Rep-CRM
This is one of the assignment of my web development course.

# Purpose: 
Solve a basic programming assignment using PHP and MySQL.

# Tasks

1. Write database access code for all of your pages in this assignment.
2. The home page must be named index.php. This home page must contain links to the catalog and customer list pages as well as your name (see below). Notice as well the link expectations for the header and left menu area; these must be consistent on all pages
3. This page must be named customer-list.php. It must display all the customers and display the first and last name, the email address, the address, the city, and country fields. The user must be able to change the sort order as shown below. As well, the user must be able to filter the customer list on the last name via the search box. This search box must be active and have the same functionality on all pages.
4. This page must be named book-list.php. This page displays a list of all books. The book titles should be links to the book-details.php page.
The links in the Categories, Imprints, Status, and Binding lists provide a way to filter the book list: e.g., clicking on an imprint will display only those books with that imprint. The information in these lists can be found in the Subcategories (NOT the Categories table), Imprints, BindingTypes, and ProductionStatuses tables.
5. This page must be named book-details.php. This page will display all the information about the book specified by the query string.
